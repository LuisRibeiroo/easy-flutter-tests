**This Extension helps you to improve the quality of your code by
accelerating your coding/testing workflow ðŸš€**


Boost your TDD-Workflow by:
* Creating a proper `xyz_test.dart` file with boilderplate code for an existing `xyz.dart` file with one click!
* Switching between `xyz.dart` file and the associated `xyz_test.dart` file instantly 
* Dramatically faster test execution  -> Run only the unit tests that affect the file you're currently working on.
* Using snippets to avoid writing boilderplate code

## Snippets

| Snippet Prefix | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `ftest`        | Creates `test('<test-name>', () {<test-code>})` |

It provides the following features:

- âœ… Command for generating a proper `xyz_test.dart` file for an existing `xyz.dart` file 
    - âœ… same location inside of /test as in /lib
    - âœ… includes default boilerplate testing code

- âœ…  Command for switching between `xyz.dart` file and the associated `xyz_test.dart` file instantly

- âœ… Command for executing only the unit tests inside of one test file, instead of all unit tests
    * Same as executing `$> flutter test <path-to-testfile>` in the terminal
    * Makes it much faster to check, if all unit tests inside of  -->
