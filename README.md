**Improve the quality of your code by
accelerating your coding/testing workflow ðŸš€**


Boost your TDD-Workflow by:
* âœ… Creating a proper `xyz_test.dart` file with boilderplate code for an existing `xyz.dart` file with one click!
* âœ… Switching between `xyz.dart` file and the associated `xyz_test.dart` file instantly 
* âœ… Dramatically faster test execution  -> Run only the unit tests that affect the file you're currently working on.
* âœ… Using snippets to avoid writing boilderplate code

## Snippets

| Snippet Prefix | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ftest`        | Creates `test('<test-name>', () {<test-code>})`        |
| `fgroup`       | Creates `group('<group-name>', () {<multiple-tests>})` |

## Commands

| Command ( + context menu)        | Shortcut | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Better Tests: Go to tests        | âŒ˜+T      | Creates file `xyz_test.dart`  for file `xyz.dart` in the  `/test` folder. Will automatically create the necessary folder tree under `/test` to match the location of `xyz.dart` under `/lib`.<br />If `xyz_test.dart` already exists, editor will show it. |
| Better Tests: Go to source file  | âŒ˜+T      | Opens the `xyz.dart` file if you are inside a `xyz_test.dart` file. |
| Better Tests: Run tests for file | âŒ¥+âŒ˜+T    | Executes all tests inside of a `xyz_test.dart`. Works also if you are currently inside of `xyz.dart` |

<!-- 
It provides the following features:

- âœ… Command for generating a proper `xyz_test.dart` file for an existing `xyz.dart` file 
    - âœ… same location inside of /test as in /lib
    - âœ… includes default boilerplate testing code

- âœ…  Command for switching between `xyz.dart` file and the associated `xyz_test.dart` file instantly

- âœ… Command for executing only the unit tests inside of one test file, instead of all unit tests
    * Same as executing `$> flutter test <path-to-testfile>` in the terminal
    * Makes it much faster to check, if all unit tests inside of  -->
