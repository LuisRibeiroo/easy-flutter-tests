**Improve the quality of your code by
accelerating your coding/testing workflow üöÄ**


Boost your TDD-Workflow by:
* ‚úÖ Creating a proper `xyz_test.dart` file with boilderplate code for an existing `xyz.dart` file with one click!
* ‚úÖ Switching between `xyz.dart` file and the associated `xyz_test.dart` file instantly 
* ‚úÖ Dramatically faster test execution  -> Run only the unit tests that affect the file you're currently working on.
* ‚úÖ Using snippets to avoid writing boilderplate code

## Create test file or switch between tests and code with ‚åò+T

## Execute Tests for the current file with ‚å•+‚åò+T

## Commands Summary

| Command ( + context menu)        | Shortcut | Description                                                  |

| Better Tests: Go to source file  | ‚åò+T      | Opens the `xyz.dart` file if you are inside a `xyz_test.dart` file. |
| Better Tests: Run tests for file | ‚å•+‚åò+T    | Executes all tests inside of a `xyz_test.dart`. Works also if you are currently inside of `xyz.dart` |
