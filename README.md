This Extension helps you to improve the quality of your code by
accelerating your coding/testing workflow.

It provides the following features:
- ✅ Command for generating a proper test file for an existing .dart file 
    - ✅ creates the _test.dart file at the same location in the /test folder
    - ✅ includes default boilerplate testing code

- ✅ Command for executing all unit tests inside of one test file.
    * Same as typing `$> flutter test <path-to-testfile>` into the terminal
